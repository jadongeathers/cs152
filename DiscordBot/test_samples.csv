Speaking as lecurer of 16-19 year olds in the subject of health and social care, there is a radical difference between their generation and mine with regards to acceptance (and not just tolerance) of non-hetrosexual cisgender people and issues. I bring it up constantly in my teaching and have a significant number of case study issues that bring up sexuality and gender in younger and older case studies. They are, most of the time, very ""okay"" with it and get quite affronted with inequality. I am of the view that in the future, such an instituation will start to become null void as a ""requirement"" - the future generation will embrace this.
