I know I'm 100% straight, if gay marriage is legalised I won't be changing my preference. If this is the push for people to come out of hiding lives then more power to them, everyone deserves true happiness and peace in life",No target,lgbt,0,0,0

21,"Our Creator established rules governing marriage long before governments began regulating the institution. The opening book of the Bible tells us: “A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24) The Hebrew word “wife,” according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words, “connotes one who is a female human being.” Jesus confirmed that those yoked together in marriage should be “male and female.”—Matthew 19:4.",Topic,lgbt,2,1,0

48,"I don't see the problem in the idea. Speaking as lecurer of 16-19 year olds in the subject of health and social care, there is a radical difference between their generation and mine with regards to acceptance (and not just tolerance) of non-hetrosexual cisgender people and issues. I bring it up constantly in my teaching and have a significant number of case study issues that bring up sexuality and gender in younger and older case studies. They are, most of the time, very ""okay"" with it and get quite affronted with inequality. I am of the view that in the future, such an instituation will start to become null void as a ""requirement"" - the future generation will embrace this. But I'm being hopeful.",No target,lgbt,0,0,0

The terrible crap is coming from a extremist groups pushing for things like genderless children..safe schools.. Loss of parental rights and only being parent 1 and parent 2..and so on.. It's all these groups that are using the marriage equality to slip their sordid stuff into everyone's lives..Especially our children.. But they won't be our children because if you disagree the schools will deem the child mature minded and you will lose your rights to choose.,Topic,lgbt,0,0,0
